Predicting Air Quality Using Machine Learning


ABSTRACT
From the past few decades, it has been observed that urbanization and industrialisation are expanding the developed nations and are confronting the
overwhelming air contamination issue. The citizens and governments have
experienced and expressed the increasingly concerned regarding the impact
of air pollution affecting human health and proposed sustainable development for overriding air pollution issues across the worldwide. The outcome
of modern industrialization contains the liquid droplets, solid particles and
gas molecules and is spreading in the atmospheric air. The heavy concentration of particulate matter of size PM10 and PM2.5 is seriously caused adverse
health effect. Through the determination of particulate matter concentration in atmospheric air for the betterment of human being well in primary
importance.
An air quality index (AQI) is used by government agencies to communicate to the public how polluted the air currently is or how polluted it is
forecast to become. AQI information is obtained by averaging readings from
an air quality sensor, which can increase due to vehicle traffic, forest fires, or
anything that can increase air pollution.
In this project machine learning predictive models for forecasting particulate matter concentration in atmospheric air are investigated on India Air
Quality Monitoring data sets. These models were compared with the existing traditional models and perform better in predictive performance. The
performance of these models was evaluated with statistical measures: Root
Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Square
Error (MSE), and Coefficient of Determination (R2
).
This project uses various machine learning algorithms to predict the Air
Quality Index used to control pollution to avoid significant health concerns.
Air Quality Index shows the quality of air pollution. The major pollutants are
particulate matters, nitrous oxide (NO2), Sulphur dioxide (SO2) and carbon
monoxide (CO). Various Machine Learning algorithms are random forest
regression, support vector regression and Linear Regression. The accuracy of
several models is measured by the root mean square error (RMSE) technique.
The highest accuracy is attained by Random Forest of R2 value 0.9833 and
Root Mean Square Value of 6.7693.
